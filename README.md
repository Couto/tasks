[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Couto/tasks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Couto/tasks)

**Tasks** is an example project to demonstrate some [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org/) capabilities, it's
clearly based on the [kanelm](https://github.com/huytd/kanelm) project but all
code was done from scratch.

## Intro

Hi! This is Tyler. Tyler has been building webapps for some time now, he
has seen fads coming and going, the rise of jQuery, the rise of Backbone... the
rise of Angular (nheeeec...) and lately the rise of React.

No matter the library/framework, applications still suffered from the
same pain points... Developers bindly trusting incoming data from external APIs,
awful error handling practices, and the mythical `undefined is not a function`.

Tyler was tired...
However, Tyler started to see this new language coming around in the news...
Elm... 

Elm... is pleasant to use
Elm... has no runtime errors
Elm... has lovely error messages < What the heck? How can errors be lovely?

So Tyler diped his toes in Elm...

# Baby steps

So... how to can I use Elm?

Two ways:

1. Dowload the installer (what's is this? 1999?)
1. Use npm (wait! npm?!!... won't  I get a King of the Hill episode instead of
   our package?)

```
npm install --global elm
```
