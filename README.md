[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Couto/tasks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Couto/tasks)

**Tasks** is an example project to demonstrate some [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org/) capabilities, it's
clearly based on the [kanelm](https://github.com/huytd/kanelm) project but all
code was done from scratch.
